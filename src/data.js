        text:"â€œI started my software development career as an intern and now have completed two years at Jeavio. Being a night owl, one of the perks that I enjoy are flexible work hours. I was assigned responsibilities very early in my career which improved my decision-making skills. Moreover, Jeavio changed my notion of work-life which I used to perceive as boring before starting my corporate life, into completely enjoyable by the activities that happen at regular intervals. Working with Jeavio has been a great experience!"
